Initial: have user input of song lyrics or keywords -> send to Shazam to return all artists who have played the song -> send each artist + song title to Youtube

return each cover in an iframe

Some option to create a playlist 

eventually: get all the songs people like on all platform and send them a playlist organized alphabetically by artist of all the songs they like

(could eventually use ML to determine if a Youtube video is a song or not, same process as designing a spam filter)
